# Visual Quality Assessment

Maintained by: [Teo Wu](https://teowu.github.io) (Haoning Wu)

üåüNew: We have published a benchmark for **multi-modality large language models (MLLMs)** on low-level vision and visual quality assessment!

See our üñ•Ô∏è[codebase](https://github.com/VQAssessment/Q-Bench) and üìë[paper](https://https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374156853_Q-BENCH_A_BENCHMARK_FOR_GENERAL-PURPOSE_FOUNDATION_MODELS_ON_LOW-LEVEL_VISION)!


We are a young research team from [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](ntu.edu.sg) and [Sensetime Research](sensetime.com), aiming to build efficient and explainable Image and Video Quality Assessment approaches as well as exploring the perceptual mechanisms behind the human quality perception.
